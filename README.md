# Cyclic-Subgroup-count

So the whole idea behind this project, was to help me reinforce some of the material I have been learning in class while also learning how to code.
Sometimes, it's better to learn by doing and it is harder to learn things when the thing you're learning serves no purpose. There is just something about
spamming codecademy with different varieties of print("Hello World!") that is just incredibly boring. 

I left numerous comments in the actual .py file for this project but I welcome questions about what the code is doing and why certain functions exist.
That's really all there is to ay about this project but I hope you guys enjoy playing around with the code and feel free to send me some constructive
feedback on my code (emphasis on the consturctive part).
